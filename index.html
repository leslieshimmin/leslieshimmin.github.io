                <h3>Nothing New In The Ancient World</h3>

                <p>For most ancient cultures going beyond the realm of the senses is an everyday occurrence.<br />
                Travelling to other dimensions remains a built in part of their society.</p>

                <p>Transcending so-called reality is achieved through dance, ritual or meditation practices that are still in use today.<br />
                Although the logical may find it difficult to achieve, a little faith and open mindedness can go a long way.</p>

                <h3>It's Happening All The Time</h3>

                <p>People may think it's impossible to travel beyond this physical reality,<br />
                but we all dream when we sleep.<br />
                And when we are daydreaming or spacing out,<br />
                it is nothing but a trance.</p>

                <p>Whether one believes in it or not,<br />
                trance is the tool to get to the 4th dimension,<br />
                and that place is nothing short of the world in our dreams.</p>
