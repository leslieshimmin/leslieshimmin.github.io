    <p>
      An interest in all things has lead me to practice a great many things.
      There is no subject matter that I do not find useful.
      Due to the grace of circumstance and good company, I have studied under good teachers,
      gaining skills and knowledge in the arts, languages and cultures.

      My journey in web development started with an interest in tech stocks and the story arc of the companies.
      This lead to research into computer languages and their founders.
      After settling into python, working on projects, I needed web development skills in order to see my goals to fruition.
      I have design ideas and am mostly inspired by what I have yet to see in websites.
      For instance, <a href="https://www.prokerala.com/astrology/birth-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prokeraia</a> is an intersting site for those into western astrology. 
      It gives a slightly different perspective from an Eastern point of view.
      The website, although fun, is not inspiring because of any development quality , but more so because it shows the room for improvement in this genre and in general.
