                Advertisisement and propoganda have always been around, but recently the two have joined forces and reached a fever pitch.<br>
                Humanity is growing and changing at a rapid pace, at the same time, so is the fight for human attention and ultimately control of human beliefs.

            <h2 style="text-align:right; font-style: italic;"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase;"></span>The War for the Mind</h2>
            <p>
                While internet conglomerates have fought for advertising dollars, vying for human attention, and even more sinister spectre has entered the stage.<br>
                The complacency and capitulation has reached a point wherein humanity can no longer tell right from wrong.

                Although there was confusion during World War II, it was pretty clear where any reasonable person stood.

                This day and age, a vast amount of people no longer possess the common sense to look out for their own best interest.

                With the power the internet foreign govenrments are able to access en masse the feeble minded citizens of rival countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may see an unprecedented devolution of the human mind on such a scale it will endanger the lives of the majority of humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the plus side each individual will have an opportunity to use common sense, look beyond conspiracy theories and mind control, providing a clear path to a healthy life.
