      <h3>React Immersion for Beginners MeetUp</h3>
      <p>This <a href="https://starweaver.com/on-air/react-immersion-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetUp</a> 
        is hosted by Shaun Wassell of Starweaver, who is a Senior React Developer, freelancer, consultant and online educator.
        Through MeetUp, Starweaver offers a 4 hour React introductory course. Free classes can also be found directly on their website.
        The objective of this meetUp is to provide a solid foundation in creating modern React web applications.

      <p>
       Frontend develpment consists of three main elements/languages; JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
       In the frontend industry, one will most likely be required to know a framework 'language'.
       Examples include React, Angular, or Vue.
       These framworks ultimately do the same thing, which is combine JS, HTML, and CSS under one 'language' or framework.
       It should be noted that a developer should have a strong grasp of the three aforementioned elements before learning any framework.
       For a beginner like myself taking a course like this could be considered'jumping the gun'.
       But it does provide a glimpse into the type of programming one will most likely be doing in a real work environment.
