      An interest in all things has lead me to practice a great many things.
      There is no subject matter that I do not find useful.
      Due to the grace of circumstance and good company, I have studied under good teachers,
      gaining skills and knowledge in the arts, languages and cultures.

      My journey in web development started with an interest in tech stocks and the story arc of the companies.
      This lead to research into computer languages and their founders.
      After settling into python, working on projects, I needed web development skills in order to see my goals to fruition.
      I have design ideas and am mostly inspired by what I have yet to see in websites.
      For instance, <a href="https://www.prokerala.com/astrology/birth-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prokeraia</a> is an intersting site for those into western astrology. 
      It gives a slightly different perspective from an Eastern point of view.
      The website, although fun, lacks development quality. More specifically, it shows the room for improvement in this genre and in general.

    It is easy to see how the visual aspect of computers commands innovation in programming. 
    Just look at the effect Video Games has had on the world.
    Two languages, Python and JavaScript, are the increasing trend in programming. 
    They represent the desire for simplicity, and in JavaScript, front-end development.
    When you you combine those trends of visuals and ease, it's not hard to see how web development and Web design are the future. 
    <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Turn of the Century</a> proved that front-end design has not only survived and flourished,
    but will thrive, innovate and lead in the years to come.
